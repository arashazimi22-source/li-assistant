1. Build & Launch
 - [ ] Project opens in Android Studio without syntax errors.
 - [ ] App installs on a test device (debug APK built).

2. Voice Enrollment & Verification
 - [ ] Enrollment UI records 10-20 sentences and stores them in app files.
 - [ ] Speaker verification placeholder is replaced with real model and verifies owner voice.
 - [ ] Sensitivity setting exists and changes verification threshold behavior.

3. STT & Vosk
 - [ ] Vosk model files present in assets or filesDir and VoskService initializes without error.
 - [ ] Recognized text appears in logs when testing sample audio.

4. Emotion Engine
 - [ ] EmotionEngine.analyzeText returns reasonable results for test phrases.
 - [ ] Avatar updates visually based on emotion output (Lottie/avatars set).

5. Memory DB
 - [ ] Insert memory, retrieve memory, and delete memory operations work.
 - [ ] Clear-all-memory deletes DB records (verify by query).

6. Modes & Personality
 - [ ] Switching modes (assistant/friend/lover) changes prompt templates and TTS parameters.

7. Privacy & Internet
 - [ ] 'allow_internet' setting controls whether AISandbox may contact remote APIs.
 - [ ] Consent logs are created when internet is enabled and when API calls are made.
 - [ ] Deleting data removes voiceprints, memories, and profile info.

8. UX & Performance
 - [ ] Avatar animation triggers (<300ms) after emotion detection in tests.
 - [ ] Background VoskService runs 30 minutes without crash (monitor logs).
 - [ ] Battery usage reasonable for target device class.

9. Security
 - [ ] Voiceprints stored encrypted or hashed; raw audio removable.
 - [ ] API keys (if used) stored securely (Android Keystore) and not in code.
 - [ ] Clear explanation to user that Li is an app, not a human, and consent screens exist for intimate behaviors.

Notes:
 - Several items require integrating third-party models (Vosk, speaker-embedding, local LLM). The scaffold places hooks and instructions for each.
 - After building, perform manual tests using the QA checklist above and record results.
