Li Companion - Full scaffold README

This project scaffold implements the Li Companion app structure requested by the user.
It is offline-first with placeholders for:
 - Voice enrollment & speaker verification
 - Vosk-based offline STT (user must add model files)
 - EmotionEngine (rule-based) with hook for TFLite models
 - Memory DB (Room) and VoicePrint storage (placeholders)
 - Personality manager (assistant/friend/lover)
 - AISandbox: unified interface to local or remote LLM (requires model or API keys)
 - AvatarStateManager and Lottie placeholders for UI reactions

IMPORTANT: This scaffold is source-only. To get an APK, open this folder in Android Studio and build, or upload to GitHub and use the provided Actions workflow (not included here).

Steps to complete:
1. Add Vosk model files to app's filesDir or assets as described in earlier messages.
2. Integrate or port a speaker embedding model and implement SpeakerRecognition.verifySpeaker.
3. (Optional) Add a local LLM (llama.cpp) or provide remote API credentials in secure storage when enabling internet.
4. Replace avatar placeholders and Lottie JSON with final assets.
